<b> Two CloudFormation stacks </b>

A network stack that creates a VPC (virtual private cloud) with two public subnets (each in a different availability zone for high availability), an internet gateway, and a load balancer that balances traffic between those networks.

A service stack that places a Docker container with the application we want to run into each of the public networks. For this, we use ECS (Elastic Container Service) and Fargate, which makes it easier to run a Docker container.
